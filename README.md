DISCLAIMER: DUE TO A SECURITY BREACH AT HEROKU, THEY HAVE INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED GITHUB INTEGRATION MEANING I CAN NO LONGER UPLOAD CODE TO THE BOT.

This is a Discord bot I wrote in Java with the Javacord library. It's named after Talking Ben, a talking character mobile app, but the name is only temporary.

Features:
- Ask the bot a question and get a yes or no answer (!ben [question])
- Have the bot react to your question with an emoji number 1 - 10. (!react [question])
- Have the bot choose between two things. (!choose [term1] [term2])
- Bot can rate you out of 100& based on a term. (!rate [term])
- Bot organizes various terms in a list from 1 - #. (!blist [term1] [term2] [term3])
- Bot organizes terms in a tier-list from S - F. Multiple terms can be in the same rank. (!tier [term1] [term2] [term3]...)
